# sphero-bolt-pathfinding
This project was designed in a student group of 9. The group was subdivided into 3 Teams: GUI, Hardware and Algorithm. The goal of the project was to control a small robot (Sphero Bolt) that is able to analyze a surrounding maze via camera input and navigate through it by computing the shortest path through all destinations. 

__Note__: I was part of the algorithm team and therefore only worked on that part of the code. 

## Features
* Calculation of the shortest paths connecting all destinations in any given maze
* UI that displays the current position of the SpheroBolt in the respective maze
* Camera that accurately tracks the SpheroBolt via a small colored screen 
* Control of the Robot via python API
